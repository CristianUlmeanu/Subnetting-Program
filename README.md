# Subnetting-Program
A program that calculates all the IPs for every LAN (including WIFIs and the LANs between routers) from a base IP.

The program was created in order to make the process of creating multiple LANs from a base IP more efficient for my university course "Fundamentals of Computer Networks". The program needs the next set of inputs: base IP, Mask, number of LANs, number of hosts for every LAN and the number of WIFIs. After all the imputs the code gives all the information needed in order to create the topology: NA, BA, IP Range, Router IP, Server IP, Masks, The IPs in decimal form, IP Range for Switches, Default Gateaway, Maximum number of users, maximum number of switches, IP range for Hosts.
